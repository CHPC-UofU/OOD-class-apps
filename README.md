# OOD-apps
Repository of CHPC's Open OnDemand apps for classes

- most if not all apps have hard-coded job parameters and software versions
- two apps, CHEN_Jupyter and ATMOS_Synoptic, are used for multiple classes
- some class apps are not in use at the moment but are kept available
- active apps are set by symbolic links from the class apps location, `/uufs/chpc.utah.edu/sys/ondemand/chpc-class`, to the expected location on `ondemand-class`, `/var/www/ood/apps/sys`.
- for more details see [Ondemand-info/class.md](https://github.com/CHPC-UofU/OnDemand-info/blob/master/class.md)
